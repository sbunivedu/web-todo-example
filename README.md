# TODOs

The todo list example stores todo items in a text file (one todo per line) and
uses PHP script to list, add and delete todos.

```todos.php``` implements all functions in one script, whereas ```list.php```,
```add.php```, and ```delete.php``` does it in three scripts, each of which
performs a specific action as the name suggests.

This example also demonstrates the use of the following PHP functions:
* file
* file_put_contents
* array_splice
